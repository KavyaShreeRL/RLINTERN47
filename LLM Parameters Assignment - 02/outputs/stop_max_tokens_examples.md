1. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve for the day, week, and month. Having specific, measurable goals can keep you focused.

5. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what usually distractions you and find ways to minimize those distractions, whether it's turning off notifications or creating a dedicated workspace.
