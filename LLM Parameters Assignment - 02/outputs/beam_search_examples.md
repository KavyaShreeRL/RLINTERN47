## Results

### Single Beam (num_beams=1)
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to transform various industries, including healthcare, finance, and education. In healthcare, AI can enhance diagnostics, personalize treatment plans, and streamline administrative tasks. In finance, it can improve risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service through automation and data analysis. In education, AI can personalize learning experiences, automate administrative processes, and provide insights into student performance. Overall, AI's integration into these sectors promises increased efficiency, better decision-making, and improved outcomes.

**Analysis**: Straightforward, comprehensive summary.

### Multiple Beams (num_beams=5, length_penalty=1.2)
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to transform various industries, including healthcare, finance, and education. In healthcare, AI can enhance diagnostics, personalize treatment plans, and improve patient care. In finance, it can streamline operations, enhance risk assessment, and facilitate fraud detection. In education, AI can provide personalized learning experiences and automate administrative tasks. Overall, AI's ability to analyze data and improve efficiency is expected to drive significant advancements across these sectors.

**Analysis**: Slightly different phrasing, more concise due to length penalty.

## Key Findings

| Parameter | Effect | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| num_beams=1 | Single path generation | Fast, direct output |
| num_beams=5 | Multiple candidate paths | Higher quality, more options |
| length_penalty=1.2 | Encourages longer outputs | Detailed responses |
| length_penalty=0.8 | Encourages shorter outputs | Concise summaries |

**Note**: The above shows OpenAI API simulation (multiple calls, not true beam search).

## Real Beam Search Demonstration
For true beam search with actual parameter control, see:
```bash
python local_beam_search.py
```
This uses GPT-2 locally to demonstrate real beam search with num_beams=1,5 and length_penalty variations.

**Note**: OpenAI doesn't support true beam search, but similar effects achieved through temperature and seed variations.
